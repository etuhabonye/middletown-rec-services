The Association of Different Demographics and Access to Recreational Services
Emma Tuhabonye, Aidan Ward, Cal Neveu

*Research Question:*
The primary interest is investigating whether different demographics such as race, age, and income in the Middletown community invest more time and interest in certain programs offered by the Middletown Recreation and Community Services. Some such examples include aquatic, artistic, and game night programs, however we will mainly focus on areas that respondents deemed as most important such as access to activities, youth programs, and adult programs. We will also analyze possible potential barriers to participation such as cost or transportation in the events held in relation to demographics. If any of these barriers are deemed significant, we will further explore if their effects persist throughout the data. Additionally we will review how individuals find out about the department.

*Sample*

The data collection has been completed with a sample that consists of approximately 750 survey respondents. The survey was aimed to recruit non users of the facilities offered by the Middletown Recreation and Community Services. 

*Variables*

Below is a list of several select variables and their operational definitions.
Number of people: continuous, number of members within a given household
Number of children: continuous, number of children living with a given respondent
Senior identification: nominal dichotomous, whether respondent is over 65 years of age
Income: continuous, family’s total income within the last year
Hispanic/Latino: nominal dichotomous, whether respondent is Hispanic or Latino
Race: categorical 5 groups, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, Black or African      American, Native Hawaiin or Pacific Islander, White 
Areas of Interest: categorical 12 groups respondent’s 3 focus areas that they would like the Recreation Division to focus on
Transportation Barrier: nominal dichotomous, whether transportation is a barrier to respondent using the recreation services
Cost Barrier: nominal dichotomous, whether cost is a barrier to respondent using the recreation services





*Statistical Analysis Plan:*

To test if respondents of different race, age, and income status have a transportation barrier, a chi-square test will be run. (IVs = Race, Age, Income and all interactions of the previous 3 DV = Transportation Barrier)

To test to see if there is a relationship between family size and the amount of activities a family is involved in, regression analysis will be conducted. 

To identify whether there are certain types of outstanding patterns or correlations between respondents’ demographic information versus having cost or transportation as a barrier, latent class analysis will be performed. 

To visualize if the respondents know about the programs and where they hear about these programs in efforts to find which method of communication is the most effective, we plan to plot a graph. Once we have our graph, we will then examine the relationship between the demographics and the respondents knowledge of the programs with another visualization.

*Results of Statistical Analyses*

Is Transportation a Barrier by Race?

First, two categories (Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander and Native American and Alaskan) reported no transportation barrier. We are assuming that is because of the small number of individuals that identify with those categories. Black/African American has the highest proportion of individuals with a transportation barrier, while White has the lowest proportion.

	Is Cost a Barrier by Race?

First, in a similar manner, Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders did not report any cost barrier or answer Other. Asians also did not report any cost barrier, however, a number of individuals did report Other when asked about a cost barrier. We believe that this is the result of there being a small number of people who identify with that category. Next, the other section saw the highest proportion of individuals with a cost barrier. The second highest proportion was seen in the Black/African American category. The Native American/Alaskan and White categories were very similar, however, the proportion of individuals that responded Other was dramatically higher in the Native American/Alaskan category than in the White category. 

	Is Transportation a Barrier by Income?

An expected pattern was observed in this category where as income increased, transportation cost became less of a barrier. This was expected because, with a higher income comes a greater ability to afford the transportation costs to the recreation department for programs and activities. Unexpectedly, however, the highest income category (more than $115,999) has a larger proportion of respondents with a transportation cost barrier than the second highest income category ($104,000-115,999). We estimated that this abnormal shift results from larger incomes that may allow these individuals to live outside of town – far away from the recreation department – which can result in higher transportation costs. We will test to see if this unexpected finding is statistically significant.

	Is Cost a Barrier by Income?

The general trend that we observed in this category was that as income increased, those who reported cost as a barrier decreased. Although the answer to this question seems obvious, as cost barriers clearly are higher for those with lower income and vise versa, we are able to get solid quantitative information. For instance, about 10% of those making over $165,000 per year (the highest reportable income bracket) reported cost as a barrier whereas upwards of 60% of those making under $26,000 per year (the lowest reportable income bracket) reported cost as a barrier. So, our results demonstrate that when looking at the greatest income disparities within Middletown, we see that there is an extremely large gap among those reporting cost as a barrier.


*Conclusion and Implications*

Several conclusions can be gathered from these results. For example, looking at the cost and transportation barriers, we can see that there is a disparity among the different demographics of Middletown residents in regards to the obstacles they face when accessing the parks and rec program. 
Some limitations can also be noted as well. Looking at the race graphics, as noted above, there is no variety in responses of certain demographics. We’ve concluded that this unrealistically low variety is resultant from the small number of responses from individuals identifying with these given demographics.
Additionally, a lack of continuous variables from the survey prevents us from conducting certain tests (such as factor analysis) as well as creating certain graphics (such as scatterplots). One key variable that has contributed to this limitation multiple times is the income variable, which is categorical and discrete instead of continuous.
