This space, which includes a large gym, pool, multipurpose space and administrative offices will serve as the new home for Middletown Recreation division. This space will be open to the public in 2022. In order to plan our programming, we want and need your input! 
 The Recreation Division seeks to enhance the quality of life for all Middletown residents with regard to recreational, athletic and leisure services. Through community partnerships, long range planning, and professional management, the Division is committed to the highest level of equitable service, integrity, safety and fiscal management.
Specifically we offer programs ranging from swim lessons to athletics to arts to crafts to dance and everything in between. 
We’d love to hear what you want to see happening in our new space. For those that respond, we will raffle off two $50 gift cards (your choice of Downtown Business District or Amazon).

 We are seeking your consent to participate in a survey conducted by the Middletown recreation department with the help of Wesleyan University. Your participation is voluntary.  We are asking you to fill out a survey online. We think the survey will take about  15 minutes to finish. There are no risks associated with participating in this study. Although this study will not benefit you personally, we hope that the results will help us to better the community. This information may influence future programs. 
All of your responses will be confidential. No one will ever know your answers. In the end we will ask if you want to provide your name, phone number and/or e-mail address so that we can notify you if you win one of the gift cards in the drawing. This information will never be linked to your answers to the survey. Only the researchers involved in this study will have access to the information you provide.        Your participation is completely voluntary.  You are free to decide not to participate, to stop participating at any time for any reason, or to refuse to answer any individual question without penalty.     I
